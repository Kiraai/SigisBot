# SigisBot

A projoect focused on helping GW2 community with doing raids.

As for now, it's more of an idea than a bot, but if everythings works correctly, it should have features such:

1) Helping with builds;
2) Remembering discord srvr member's roles;
3) Generating polls (how many people are raiding, which roles we have etc.);
