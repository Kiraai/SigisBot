# SigisBot (WIP NAME)

A projoect focused on helping GW2 community with doing raids.

As for now, it's more of an idea than a bot, but if everythings works correctly and I have enough time to code it, the bot should have features such as:

1) Helping with builds;
2) Remembering discord srvr member's roles;
3) Generating polls (how many people are willing to raid, which roles we have etc.);
4) More ideas to come!

If there's something that comes to your mind that could be included in this project write to Kirai#5848
